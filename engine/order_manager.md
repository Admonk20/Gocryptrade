## Current Features for Order Manager
+ The order manager subsystem stores and monitors all orders from enabled exchanges with API keys and `authenticatedSupport` enabled
+ It can be enabled or disabled via runtime command `-ordermanager=false` and defaults to true
+ All orders placed via GoCryptoTrader will be added to the order manager store
+ Any futures based order will be tracked via the [futures positions controller](/exchanges/order/README.md) which can be used to track PNL. Use GRPC command [getfuturesposition](https://api.gocryptotrader.app/#gocryptotrader_getfuturesposition) to view position data for an exchange, asset, pair
